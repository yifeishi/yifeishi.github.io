Hi there! 👋

test I am a Ph.D. Candidate (Graduate Research Assistant) in Chemical Engineering at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/), and a member of the [CODES Research Group](https://fernandolima.faculty.wvu.edu/). In addition, I hold both a M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees also in Chemical Engineering. 

Throughout my career, I have developed algorithms and methods to efficiently solve problems related
to [Process Systems Engineering (PSE)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135421000302), giving me experience in:

- Process modeling
- Advanced process control
- Plantwide control
- Nonlinear constrained optimization
- Supervised machine learning.

My current goal is to conduct further research on the design, modeling, control and assessment of chemical processes. Lastly, I have experience working with the industry, mainly the oil and gas, petrochemical and energy sectors.
