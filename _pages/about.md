Hi there! 👋

I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), holding a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). In addition, I also have an M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Chemical Engineering, both at the [Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil](https://portal.ufcg.edu.br). 

Throughout my career, I have developed algorithms and methods to efficiently solve problems related
to [Process Systems Engineering (PSE)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135421000302), giving me experience in:

- Process modeling
- Advanced process control
- Plantwide control
- Nonlinear constrained optimization
- Supervised machine learning.

My current goal is to conduct further research on the design, modeling, control and assessment of chemical processes. Lastly, I have experience working with the industry, mainly the oil and gas, petrochemical and energy sectors.
